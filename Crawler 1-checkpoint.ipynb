      "Faced with today's innovative blow-up of cloud technologies, we are forced to rebuild services in terms of cloud. In the rebuilding, considering the facet of cloud as a social infrastructure, security is a critical problem of clouds. Most of insecurity against clouds can be summarized as social insecurity, which is classified into the multiple stakeholder problem, the open space security problem, and the mission critical data handling problem. As a solution of those problems, we propose a new cloud trust model. In our cloud trust model, in addition to conventional trust models, we consider both internal trust that is the TPM of this model, and contracted trust that controls cloud service providers under contracts and related documents. We call the cloud platform that meets the cloud trust model as “Security Aware Cloud.” In a security aware cloud, internal trust must be established as the firm base of trust. By implementing TPM of security such as Id management and key management on internal trust, we obtain a firm trust model. Moreover, by controlling levels of quality of service and security by contract, we can optimize ROI on service and security delegated to a cloud.\n",

      "Internet clouds work as service factories built around Web-scale data centers. The elastic cloud resources and huge datasets processed are subject to security breaches, privacy abuses, and copyright violations. Provisioned cloud resources on-demand are especially vulnerable to cyber attacks. The cloud platforms built by Google, IBM, and Amazon all reveal this weaknesses. We propose a new approach to integrating virtual clusters, security-reinforced data centers, and trusted data accesses guided by reputation systems. A hierarchy of P2P reputation systems is suggested to protect clouds and data centers at the site level and to safeguard the data objects at the file-access level. Different security countermeasures are suggested to protect cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, currently implemented by Amazon, IBM, and Google, respectively.\n",

      "Security and interoperability is the biggest challenge to promote cloud computing currently. Trust has proved to be one of the most important and effective alternative means to construct security in distributed systems. In order to efficiently and safely construct entities' trust relationship in cloud and cross-clouds environment, this paper proposed a novel cloud trust model and a new cloud security framework. The propose trust model is domain-based. It divides one cloud provider's resource nodes into the same trust domain. It designs different trust strategies for different roles. Trust recommendation is treated as one type of cloud services just like computation or storage. Based on the proposed trust model, it introduced a novel cloud security framework with an independent trust management module. Using the proposed security model, it introduced some trust-based security mechanisms. Results of simulation experiments show that the proposed security model can achieve high transaction success rate with high trust accuracy.\n",

      "Cloud computing signifies a paradigm shift from owning computing systems to buying computing services. As a result of this paradigm shift, many key concerns such as the transparency of data transfer and access within the cloud, and the lack of clarity in data ownership were surfaced. To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity. TrustCloud also extends detective techniques to policies and regulations governing IT systems.\n",

      "While Cloud usage increasingly involves security considerations, there is still a conspicuous lack of techniques for users to assess/ensure that the security level advertised by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is actually delivered. Recent efforts have proposed extending existing Cloud Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to the security domain, by creating Security SLAs (SecLAs) along with attempts to quantify and reason about the security assurance provided by CSPs. However, both technical and usability issues limit their adoption in practice. In this paper we introduce a new technique for conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis of the security level provided by CSPs. Our methodology significantly improves upon contemporary security assessment approaches by creating a novel decision making technique based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) that allows the comparison and benchmarking of the security provided by a CSP based on its SecLA. Furthermore, our technique improves security requirements specifications by introducing a flexible and simple methodology that allows users to identify their specific security needs. The proposed technique is demonstrated with real-world CSP data obtained from the Cloud Security Alliance's Security, Trust and Assurance Registry.\n",

Location of data and processes makes the difference in the realm of computation. On one hand, an individual has full control on data and processes in his/her computer. On the other hand, we have the cloud computing wherein, the service and data maintenance is provided by some vendor which leaves the client/customer unaware of where the processes are running or where the data is stored. So, logically speaking, the client has no control over it. The cloud computing uses the internet as the communication media. When we look at the security of data in the cloud computing, the vendor has to provide some assurance in service level agreements (SLA) to convince the customer on security issues. Organizations use cloud computing as a service infrastructure, critically like to examine the security and confidentiality issues for their business critical insensitive applications. Yet, guaranteeing the security of corporate data in the \\\"cloud\\\" is difficult, if not impossible, as they provide different services like Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Each service has their own security issues. So the SLA has to describe different levels of security and their complexity based on the services to make the customer understand the security policies that are being implemented. There has to be a standardized way to prepare the SLA irrespective to the providers. This can help some of the enterprises to look forward in using the cloud services. In this paper, we put forward some security issues that have to be included in SLA.\n",

Many production-level clouds optimistically assume that all cloud nodes are equally trustworthy when dispatching jobs; jobs are dispatched based on node load, not reputation. This increases their vulnerability to attack, since compromising even one node suffices to corrupt the integrity of many distributed computations. This paper presents and evaluates Hatman: the first full-scale, data-centric, reputation-based trust management system for Hadoop clouds. Hatman dynamically assesses node integrity by comparing job replica outputs for consistency. This yields agreement feedback for a trust manager based on EigenTrust. Low overhead and high scalability is achieved by formulating both consistency-checking and trust management as secure cloud computations; thus, the cloud's distributed computing power is leveraged to strengthen its security. Experiments demonstrate that with feedback from only 100 jobs, Hatman attains over 90% accuracy when 25% of the Hadoop cloud is malicious.\n",

      "Today, we have the ability to utilize scalable, distributed computing environments within the confines of the Internet, a practice known as cloud computing. In this new world of computing, users are universally required to accept the underlying premise of trust. Within the cloud computing world, the virtual environment lets users access computing power that exceeds that contained within their own physical worlds. Typically, users will know neither the exact location of their data nor the other sources of the data collectively stored with theirs. The data you can find in a cloud ranges from public source, which has minimal security concerns, to private data containing highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, medical records, or shipping manifests for hazardous material). Does using a cloud environment alleviate the business entities of their responsibility to ensure that proper security measures are in place for both their data and applications, or do they share joint responsibility with service providers? The answers to this and other questions lie within the realm of yet-to-be-written law. As with most technological advances, regulators are typically in a \\\"catch-up\\\" mode to identify policy, governance, and law. Cloud computing presents an extension of problems heretofore experienced with the Internet. To ensure that such decisions are informed and appropriate for the cloud computing environment, the industry itself should establish coherent and effective policy and governance to identify and implement proper security methods.\n",

Edges are like on demand scalability and infinite resource provisioning as per the `pay-as-you-go' manner in favour of a single information owner (abbreviated as INO from now onwards) to multiple corporate INOs. While outsourcing information to a cloud storage controlled by a cloud service provider (abbreviated as CSP from now onwards) relives an information owner of tackling instantaneous oversight and management needs, a significant issue of retaining the control of that information to the information owner still needs to be solved. This paper perspicaciously delves into the facts of the Cloud Computing security issues and aims to explore and establish a secure channel for the INO to communicate with the CSP while maintaining trust and confidentiality. The objective of the paper is served by analyzing different protocols and proposing the one in commensurate with the requirement of the security property like information or data confidentiality along the line of security in Cloud Computing Environment (CCE). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive a secure protocol by successively eliminating the dangling pitfalls that remain dormant and thereby hamper confidentiality and integrity of information that is worth exchanging between the INO and the CSP.

However, previous researchers did not attach enough importance to uncertainty in their trust models. Therefore, their models always seem arbitrary when they set some specific values to various trust levels. To remedy this problem, we declare that uncertainty should be taken into account while modeling trust. This paper presents such an approach, in which we model trust based on cloud theory, which is a promising theory to describe uncertain concepts. In other words, we regard trust between entities as a cloud, say trust cloud. Based on such a definition of trust, we further propose algorithms to compute propagated trust clouds and aggregated trust clouds, which are needed in case of trust reasoning for entities in pervasive computing environments. Besides, we also propose an approach to use our cloud-based trust model in pervasive applications, which is helpful to put our model into practice in trust-based security mechanisms.\n",

      "Trustworthy selection of cloud services has become a significant issue in emerging cloud marketplaces. As a consequence, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has formulated a self-assessment framework for cloud providers to publish their cloud platform's security controls and capabilities. This framework enables consumers to select a cloud service based on the capabilities and controls published by the providers. However, a fundamental question that arises is, how can consumers trust that the security controls are satisfied as claimed by the providers and are compliant with consumers' requirements. This paper proposes a trust-aware framework to verify and evaluate these security controls considering consumers' requirements. First, we model the security controls in the form of trust properties. Then, we introduce a taxonomy of these properties based on their semantics and identify the authorities who can validate the properties. The taxonomy of these properties is the basis of trust formalisation in our proposed framework. The framework rests on the notion of hybrid trust that combines hard and soft trust mechanisms for verifying the trust properties. Furthermore, a decision model is proposed as an integral part of the framework in order to empower consumers to determine trustworthiness of cloud providers. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed trust-aware security evaluation framework could be potentially useful in practice for consumers to determine trustworthy cloud providers in a competitive marketplace.\n",

      "Trust plays an important role in all commercial grid and cloud environments. It is the estimation of competence of a resource provider in completing a task based on reliability, security, capability and availability in the context of distributed environment. It enables users to select the best resources in the heterogeneous grid and cloud infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel trust model to evaluate the grid and cloud resources by means of resource broker. The resource broker chooses appropriate grid/cloud resource in heterogeneous environment based on the requirements of user. Our proposed trust management system is implemented with Kerberos authentication and PERMIS (privilege and role management infrastructure standard) authorization to enhance the trust of the broker itself. The proposed trust enhanced resource broker evaluates the trust value of the resources based on the identity as well as behavioral trust. The proposed model considers metrics suitable for both grid and cloud resources. The results of the experiments show that the proposed model selects the dependable and reliable resources in grid and cloud environment.\n",

      "The rate of threats against IT systems is directly proportional to the rate of growing technology. The emergence of new technology requires researchers and practitioner's attention to discover new threats in order to make it reliable. Cloud computing is an emerging technology paradigm that migrates current technological and computing concepts into utility-like solutions similar to electricity and water systems. Security issues in cloud computing is shown to be the biggest obstacle that could subvert the wide benefits of cloud computing. The new concepts that the cloud introduces, such as multi-tenancy, creates new challenges to the security community. Addressing these challenges requires, in addition to the ability to cultivate and tune the security measures developed for other systems, proposing new security policies, models, and protocols to address the unique cloud security challenges. In this work, we provide comprehensive study of cloud computing security that includes classification of known security threats and the state-of-the-art practices in the endeavor to calibrate these threats. This paper also provides the dependency level within classification and provides a solution in form of preventive actions rather than proactive actions.\n",

Usually, cloud providers provide assurances by specifying technical and functional descriptions in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the services they offer. The descriptions in SLAs are not consistent among the cloud providers even though they offer services with similar functionality. Therefore, customers are not sure whether they can identify a trustworthy cloud provider only based on its SLA. To support the customers in reliably identifying trustworthy cloud providers, we propose a multi-faceted Trust Management (TM) system architecture for a cloud computing marketplace. This system provides means to identify the trustworthy cloud providers in terms of different attributes (e.g., security, performance, compliance) assessed by multiple sources and roots of trust information.\n",

Wide-band Delphi method is proposed as a scientific means to collect the information necessary for assessing security risks. Risk assessment knowledgebases could be developed specific to each industry vertical, which then serve as inputs for security risk assessment of cloud computing platforms.

      "Cloud computing is redefining the on-demand usage of remotely-located, and highly available computing resources to the user. Unfortunately, while the many economic and technological advantages are apparent, the migration of key sector applications to the Cloud has been limited due to a major show-stopper: the paucity of quantifiable metrics to evaluate the tradeoffs (features, problems and the economics) of security. Despite the obvious value of metrics in different scenarios to evaluate such tradeoffs, a formal and standard-based approach for the addressing of security metrics in the Cloud is a much harder and very much an open issue. This paper presents our views on the importance and challenges for developing a security metrics framework for the Cloud, also taking into account our ongoing research with organizations like the Cloud Security Alliance and European projects like ABC4Trust, CoMiFin and INSPIRE.

      "As a new computing mode, cloud computing can provide users with virtualized and scalable web services, which faced with serious security challenges, however. Access control is one of the most important measures to ensure the security of cloud computing. But applying traditional access control model into the Cloud directly could not solve the uncertainty and vulnerability caused by the open conditions of cloud computing. In cloud computing environment, only when the security and reliability of both interaction parties are ensured, data security can be effectively guaranteed during interactions between users and the Cloud. Therefore, building a mutual trust relationship between users and cloud platform is the key to implement new kinds of access control method in cloud computing environment. Combining with Trust Management(TM), a mutual trust based access control (MTBAC) model is proposed in this paper. MTBAC model take both user's behavior trust and cloud services node's credibility into consideration. Trust relationships between users and cloud service nodes are established by mutual trust mechanism. Security problems of access control are solved by implementing MTBAC model into cloud computing environment. Simulation experiments show that MTBAC model can guarantee the interaction between users and cloud service nodes.\n",

One advantage of the proposed UTE is that managers of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) systems have no privilege within UTE. Therefore cloud computing managers cannot interfere in Trusted Coordinator functionality. It has been assumed UTE should be kept by a third agent without any incentives to collude with IaaS services and highly trusted to ensure confidential execution of guest virtual machines. In addition, UTE allows users to authenticate IaaS server and determine the security of cloud service before startup of virtual machine.\n",

In order to build the belief in the development of cloud computing the cloud providers must defend the user data from unauthorized access and exposure. The best approach is encrypting the data on client side before storing it in cloud storage, however, this technique has a much infirmity from the client side in terms of key management, maintenance perspective, etc. Other way could be this kind of security service like Hierarchical Attribute Set Based Encryption, encryption/decryption service if provided by same cloud storage provider, the data negotiating cannot be ruled out since same provider has access to both storage and security service.

      "In the IT world of corporate networking, how businesses store and compute data is starting to shift from in-house servers to the cloud. However, some enterprises are still hesitant to make this leap to the cloud because of their information security and data privacy concerns. Enterprises that want to invest into this service need to feel confident that the information stored on the cloud is secure. Due to this need for confidence, trust is one of the major qualities that cloud service providers (CSPs) must build for cloud service users (CSUs). To do this, a model that all CSPs can follow must exist to establish a trust standard in the industry. If no concrete model exists, the future of cloud computing will be stagnant. This paper presents a new trust model that involves all the cloud stakeholders such as CSU, CSP, and third-party auditors. Our proposed trust model is objective since it involves third-party auditors to develop unbiased trust between the CSUs and the CSPs. Furthermore, to support the implementation of the proposed trust model, we rank CSPs according to the trust-values obtained from the trust model. The final score for each participating CSP will be determined based on the third-party assessment and the feedback received from the CSUs.\n",
